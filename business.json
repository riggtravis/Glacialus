      "content":  "GD Coffee was founded in 2016 when Travis Rigg got annoyed at how much work went into ordering a small black coffee. He had to say 'I want a small black coffe.' What a pain. It would be so much easier if there was a coffee house that only had one item: a cup of coffee. GD Coffee seeks to offer that solution. Walk up to the counter, say a number, hand over twice as many dollars as that number, receive that number of cups of coffee.'"
